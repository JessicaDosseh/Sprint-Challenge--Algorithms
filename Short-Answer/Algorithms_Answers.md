#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)

Time Complexity O(n):

- This is a linear time complexity because the operation is being performed n number of times (looping).

Space complexity O(1):

- This is a constant time complexity because additional memory is not being used.

b)

Time Complexity O(n^2)

- This is a quadratic time complexity because of the nested loop

Space complexity O(1)

- This is a constant time complexity because additional memory is not being used.

c)

Time Complexity O(n)

- This is a linear time complexity because the function is called recursively n times before it reaches its base case

Space complexity O(n)

- This is a linear time complexity because the function makes n calls to the stack
